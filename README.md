# libsite-showcase
Drupal Module to populate blocks with content from across GW Libraries content. Currently pulling in content from the GW Exhibits site (Omeka) instance and DCAAP Tumblr account. 

These blocks are designed to be used in the new 'extended' regions of the main page as showcase content. Styling for the blocks is in the Libsite7 theme css and only applies to the those regions.
